#  Products Sales & Customer Retention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into product sales performance and customer retention. The analysis aims to empower data-driven decision-making by highlighting key trends, identifying top-performing products and customer segments, and revealing opportunities for strategic improvements in sales and marketing efforts.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis was curated from a Microsoft SQL database, ensuring data integrity and consistency. The SQL script used for data extraction and transformation (as previously documented in SQLQuery3.sql) leveraged advanced SQL techniques including Window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and subqueries to prepare the data for robust analysis.

## Tools Used
Microsoft SQL Server: For data storage, management, and initial data preparation.

Power BI: For data modeling, analysis, and interactive dashboard visualization.

## Key Metrics Analyzed:
Total Customers: 18K

Quantity Sold: 60K

Total Revenue: $29.36M

Order Count: 28K

Products: 130 SKUs, 17 Subcategories

Profit: $11.68M, Cost: $17.67M

## ðŸ‘¤ Customer Behavior Insights:
High Order Frequency: Most top customers placed between 27â€“28 orders, showing strong engagement.

Age Group Impact: Customers aged 50 and above generated the highest number of orders (18K) and revenue share (66.45%).

Segment Analysis: VIP customers and new customers had equal purchase quantities (9K), but new customers drove higher total sales ($11M vs. $7M for regulars).

Actionable Insight:
Older age groups and VIP segments are more valuableâ€”target loyalty campaigns and premium bundles toward them.

ðŸ›’ Product Performance Insights:
Top Performers:

Mountain-200 and Road-150 bikes dominated revenue, each contributing over $1M+.

Subcategory Revenue Share:

Road Bikes (49.47%) and Mountain Bikes (33.89%) were the major revenue contributors.

Profitability:

Highest profit margins from Road Bikes (45.37%) and Mountain Bikes (37.25%).

Low-Performers: Products like socks, vests, and gloves had minimal profit margins and high inventory count.

Actionable Insight:
Focus marketing on high-profit subcategories, and consider bundling or phasing out low-performing SKUs.

## ðŸ’¼ Customer & Product Ledger Overview:
Granular visibility into each customer's order count, quantity purchased, and revenue generated.

Product ledger tracks total units sold, revenue, cost, and profit per SKU.

## ðŸ“ˆ Recommendations:
Retention Strategy:

Introduce age-specific loyalty programs (especially for 50+ age group).

Expand personalized promotions for repeat customers with high order count.

Product Optimization:

Reallocate inventory investment from underperforming SKUs to high-margin products.

Promote bundles for low-movement accessories to increase attach rate.

Data-Driven Segmentation:

Refine customer segmentation using RFM analysis for deeper targeting.

Use order history to build predictive models for churn prevention.

## âœ… Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard enables strategic decisions by providing a 360-degree view of retail performance, product viability, and customer value. By leveraging customer age and segment behavior, and aligning product focus based on profitability, stakeholders can drive targeted growth and improved retention outcomes.
